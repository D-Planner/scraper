# Spider
The spider package is a web scraper that aggregates course data from the [ORC](https://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/timetable.main) and [Layup List](https://www.layuplist.com). It's exposed through a RESTful API whose Postman collection is described [below](#postman-üë©‚ÄçüöÄ).

## Getting Started
To run the üï∑Ô∏è without any üò©, open your terminal and enter the following command:

```
PORT="8080" \
ORC_URL="https://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/timetable.display_courses" \
LAYUP_URL="https://www.layuplist.com" \
LAYUP_COOKIE="__cfduid=d1c489445b2ea23ce62a0453fb7365a8e1581356219; _ga=GGA1.2.777740150.1578002484; _gid=GA1.2.1146741920.1581359572; _gat=1; sessionid=3v4d8j9yh6300gxww2namwfuxzt3lvk5; csrftoken=wglx4RgDv8Js1nJ7eY0ePDYGJG4GdpcRd8LnrsF9ihooZIj4guDZsGAOuBO40Tyo" \
./bin/spider
```

...or develop:

```
go run main.go
```

You should see the following:

```
