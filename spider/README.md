# Spider
The spider package is a web scraper that aggregates course data from the [ORC](https://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/timetable.main) and [Layup List](https://www.layuplist.com). It's exposed through a RESTful API whose Postman collection is described [below](#postman-üë©‚ÄçüöÄ).

## Getting Started
To run the üï∑Ô∏è without any üò©, open your terminal and enter the following command:

```
PORT="8080" \
ORC_URL="https://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/timetable.display_courses" \
LAYUP_URL="https://www.layuplist.com" \
LAYUP_COOKIE="__cfduid=d436705b2deba05e8a80fcc2ec98c5b8b1560383586; _ga=GA1.2.942041145.1560383588; _gid=GA1.2.1530077766.1560383588; _gat=1; sessionid=zfib5uah6clqoy587whqzsqiwucev2zh; csrftoken=taASqNgxNY1bSo8AyMZSDjLjbsokeE7whRGn0FPm6kw5YvPGqSQyc9j6G3MuJXCH" \
./bin/spider
```

...or develop:

```
go run main.go
```

You should see the following:

```
